# Tier-Placeholder-Tile
I've notice that in Tierlist maker upon creating a tier list that there wasn't an option for placeholders for text image boxes so I created this script which can be installed through tampermonkey to make your own placeholder tiles onto the tier list. So instead of adding images you can add placeholders.
